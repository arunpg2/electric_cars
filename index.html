    	<p>Electric cars or electric vehicles (EVs) are fully electric and rely on batteries for their power. 
        <br>There are plug-in hybrids that act like EVs but can also operate like gas-electric hybrids. 
		    <br>Electric motors are more efficient than gasoline or diesel engines and can provide cheaper operation per mile.
       	<br>The shift to EVs would lead to a 92% fall in greenhouse gases by 2050.
       	<br>
        <br>This visualization will show the sales of <b>EVs</b> in the last decade.
        <br>Mainly <b>BEV</b> (Battery electric vehicle) and <b>PHEV</b> (Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle).
